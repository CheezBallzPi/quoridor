# Quoridor

Python version of Quoridor that will (eventually maybe) be practice for reinforcement learning?

## General Rules

- Pieces placed on (0,4) and (8,4)
- Pieces move one space at a time
- Players start with 10 walls
- Walls (size of 2 spaces) are placed between spaces to block pieces
- Pieces must always have a path to the end
- Goal is to reach the end
